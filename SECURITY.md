# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Hey there! Thanks for taking an interest in the security of stream-blockify. I appreciate your help in keeping this project secure for everyone.

If you've found a security issue, please send an email to <ahmedheltaher@gmail.com>. I'll review and address reports as promptly as possible.

## What to Include

When reporting an issue, it's super helpful if you can provide:

- A brief description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce if possible
- Any potential impact you foresee

## Disclosure

I'd appreciate if you'd hold off on public disclosure until there's been a chance to investigate and implement a fix. This helps protect users who might be affected.

## A Note of Thanks

I genuinely appreciate anyone who takes the time to report security issues. Your patience and help make a big difference to this project.

I'll happily acknowledge your contribution (with your permission) once the issue is resolved.

Thanks for helping keep stream-blockify secure!
